Project to program better physics controller


This will basically talk about 

Understanding more 2D character controllers

-> Variable jump height || Releasing button early 
-> Apex modifiers || On the peak of your jump what you want to do 
-> Jump buffering || If jump was pressed before landing 
-> Coyote timing  || Ability to jump just a few frames after player left platform
-> Clamped fall speed || Controlling player while Falling 
-> Edge detection || Nuding them in opposite direction for a few frames


On maths ends :: 
-> understanding local space mapping to world space mapping 
-> Lerp
-> Quaternion 
-> Basic understanding of algebra to visualize all vector methods


On uneven(slopes) surface gotta learn how to tilt player object (Probably tan p/b ?)
Ray cast on a particular angle
